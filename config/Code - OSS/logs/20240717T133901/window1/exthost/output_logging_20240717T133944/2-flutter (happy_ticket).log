In order to run your application, type:

  $ cd .
  $ flutter run

Your application code is in ./lib/main.dart.

Newer than known valid Java version (22.0.1), gradle (7.6.3).
 Treating as valid configuration.
The configured version of Java detected may conflict with the Gradle version in your new Flutter app.

[RECOMMENDED] If so, to keep the default Gradle version 7.6.3, make
sure to download a compatible Java version
(Java 11 <= compatible Java version < Java 20).
You may configure this compatible Java version by running:
`flutter config --jdk-dir=<JDK_DIRECTORY>`
Note that this is a global configuration for Flutter.


Alternatively, to continue using your configured Java version, update the Gradle
version specified in the following file to a compatible Gradle version:
/home/tails/Flutter Project/happy_ticket/android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties

You may also update the Gradle version used by running
`./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version=<COMPATIBLE_GRADLE_VERSION>`.

See
https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/compatibility.html#java for details
on compatible Java/Gradle versions, and see
https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html#sec:upgrading_wrapper
for more details on using the Gradle Wrapper command to update the Gradle version
used.
